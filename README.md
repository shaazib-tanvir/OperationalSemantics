# OperationalSemantics

This is a formalization of Operational Semantics of the WHILE language from [Chapter 8 of this book](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs1951x/static_files/main.pdf). It is slightly different from the original text and contains a deeply embedded DSL and more value categories than just natural numbers.
